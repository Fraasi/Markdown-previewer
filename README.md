Live Markdown Previewer
-----

Github readmes were pain in the beginning, so naturally had to code my own preview machine with instructions eventually.  
Easy now to test and write these things.  
Also my first dabble into react.

I tried to get highlighting into it, but couldn't get it to work in a contenteditable div in real time without major bugs.

You can fiddle with it

if you forgot how to README.md
